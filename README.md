# Next.js 15 Conference App

An interactive conference explorer app built with Next.js 15, React 19 features, View Transitions, Ariakit, Tailwind CSS v4 and Prisma.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies (with `--force` due to old packages):

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Prisma Setup

You need decide between prisma local development with `sqlite` or a real database with for example `postgresql` or `sqlserver`. Define it in the `schema.prisma` file.

Consider adding a `.env` file to the root of the project and use the environment variables inside `schema.prisma` with `env("DATABASE_URL")`, refer to `.env.sample`.

When using sqlite, initialize the database with:

```bash
npm run prisma.push
```

Seed prisma/seed.ts for initial data:

```sh
npm run prisma.seed
```

To view your data in the database, you can run:

```bash
npm run prisma.studio
```

When using a real database with for example postgresql or sqlserver, you need to migrate the database schema with:

```bash
npm run prisma.migrate
```
